1.  Introduction

   The Jetpack project is a multiplayer game where players navigate
   through a map, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. This document
   specifies the communication protocol between the client and server,
   as well as the format of the map files used in the game.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:
   - Client: The game application running on the player's machine.
   - Server: The central server managing game state and player interactions.
   - Map: A 2D grid defining the game environment, including coins and
		obstacles.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The Jetpack protocol is a text-based protocol over TCP.   It supports
   commands for player registration, position updates, and game events.
   Each message is terminated by a CRLF ("\r\n").

4.  Protocol Specification

4.1.  Connection Model

   Clients connect to the server using a TCP socket. Upon connection,
   the server assigns a unique player ID and sends the map data.

4.2.  Message Types

   - IDP <player_id>: Sent by the server to assign a player ID.
   - POS <x> <y>: Sent by the client to update the player's position.
   - CON <x> <y>: Sent by the server to define a coin's position.
   - BAR <x> <y>: Sent by the server to define a barrier's position.
   - COC <player_id> <x> <y>: Sent by the server when a player collects
		a coin.
   - DED <player_id>: Sent by the server when a player dies.
   - WIN <player_id>: Sent by the server when a player wins.

4.3.  Packet Structure

   Each packet consists of a command followed by arguments, separated by
   spaces.  For example:

      "POS 100.5 200.0\r\n"

5.  Map Format Specification

      The map is a text file where each character represents a tile:
         - 'c': Coin
         - 'e': Electric barrier
         - '_': Empty space

		Example:
      
      	"________e______cccccc__________"

6.  Security Considerations

	The protocol does not include encryption or authentication. It is
	recommended to use a secure transport layer (e.g., TLS) for production
	deployments.
